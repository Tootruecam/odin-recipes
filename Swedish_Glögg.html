    <h2>Old-Fashioned Swedish Glögg</h2>
        <body>
            <p>Glögg is a Swedish punch made from spiced wine. My grandfather brought this recipe over from Sweden in 1921. We still use it today. "God Jul!"</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 (750 milliliter) bottles port wine</li>

        <li>1 (750 milliliter) bottle 100 proof bourbon whiskey</li>
            
        <li>1 (750 milliliter) bottle white rum</li>
            
        <li>1 (3 inch) cinnamon stick</li>
            
        <li>1 (3 inch) strip of orange peel</li>
            
        <li>4 whole cloves</li>
            
        <li>3 whole cardamom pods, cracked</li>
            
        <li>1 (8 inch) square of cheesecloth</li>
            
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            
        <li>1 (15 ounce) package dark raisins</li>
            
        <li>1 (6 ounce) package blanched slivered almonds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat port wine in a large stockpot with a lid over medium heat until just below the simmering point. Add bourbon and rum; heat until just below simmering. Save the bottles and their caps for storing leftover glögg.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, place cinnamon stick, orange peel, cloves, and cardamom pods in the center of the cheesecloth square. Gather edges of the cheesecloth and tie with kitchen twine to secure; set aside.</li>

        <li>When wine mixture is very hot but not boiling, carefully light it with a long-handled match. Wearing a heatproof cooking mitt, carefully pour sugar into the flames; let mixture burn for 1 minute. Place the lid on the stockpot to extinguish the flames and turn off the heat. Let mixture cool, covered, about 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add the cheesecloth spice bundle, raisins, and almonds to warm wine mixture; let it cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.</li>

        <li>Strain cooled glögg and reserve the raisins and almonds.</li>

        <li>To serve: Pour glögg into a saucepan and warm over medium-low heat until hot but not simmering, about 5 minutes. Ladle 3 ounces of warmed glögg into a small coffee cup or a small Swedish-style glögg mug, and garnish each serving with a few reserved raisins and almonds.</li>
